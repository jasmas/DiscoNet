DiscoNet Package
################

DiscoNet scans specified subnets and IPs for SSH servers that can be accessed with the
provided credentials and executes an arbitrary list of commands.

The process of scanning networks and collecting command output is built on a multiprocess
architecture, so DiscoNet can rapidly scan through management and loopback subnets,
populating an xlsx workbook with the output.

Installation
------------

Install DiscoNet using the latest version of setuptools and pip::

    $ pip install --upgrade setuptools pip
    $ pip install DiscoNet

You can also opt to install the DiscoNet GUI which uses the Kivy library. To install it,
you will first need to follow the `Kivy Installation Instructions <https://kivy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/installation.html>`_ for your platform.
Then install DiscoNet with the GUI marker::

    $ pip install DiscoNet[kivy]

Binary distributions for OS X and Windows are available `here <https://github.com/jasmas/DiscoNet/releases>`_.

Usage
-----

The GUI and command line application take several input parameters:
    * workbook: Path to output xlsx file
    * subnets: Comma delimited list of networks and IP addresses to scan
    * username: SSH username
    * password: SSH password
    * commands: One per line in the GUI or passed as parameters from the command line

Examples:
    To open the GUI application::
    
        $ python -m DiscoNet
    
    To scan and create a discovery workbook from the command line::
    
        $ python -m DiscoNet.discoveryscan workbook subnets username password commands
    
    A convenience script is included so that the GUI and command line utility can each be
    run using the following commands accordingly::
    
        $ DiscoNet
        $ discoveryscan workbook subnets username password commands ...
    
    Use double quotes for each command and include as many as required, e.g.::
    
        $ discoveryscan out.xlsx 172.16.0.0/24 admin password "show ver" "show run"

API
---

To use the module in your own projects, please reference the `API Documentation <https://disconet.readthedocs.io>`_.

Examples:
    Initiate a discovery scan from python::
    
        from DiscoNet.discoveryscan import DiscoveryScan
        
        d = DiscoveryScan(workbook, subnets, username, password, [commands, ...])
        d.start()
        
    The commands parameter should be a list of command strings. The start method will
    block until the scan is complete. Optionally, the start method can be non-blocking
    when supplied with a callback function::
    
        from DiscoNet.discoveryscan import DiscoveryScan
        
        def cb()
            #callback function
            return
        
        d = DiscoveryScan(workbook, subnets, username, password, [commands, ...])
        d.start(cb)
